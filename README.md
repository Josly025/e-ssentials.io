## Description \*\*\*

Modish Music is an application that allows users
to view their favorite albums, tracks, and listen to a 30-second
preview of mulitple tracks. A SVG animation keeps track of
the 30 second preview to show how much time is remaining.
Additionally, searching through thousands of albums and songs
can be accompished with the search input. The UI is made with
UI Kit and the data comes from Deezer Audio.

Blockers: The main blocker was incoporating the SVG circle to
border the ablum cover while the song is playing. Additionally,
I learned who to use Media Queries in JavaScript in order to
solve the responive problem with the SVG size.
